> What is a "CobugBotGUI?"
---
- **The CobugBotGUI is a complimentary web application built for adding content to the CobugBot Discord bot via a user-friendly and easily accessible web interface. The CobugBot is an insult bot and this application allows end-users to add their own insults to the bot's database, from which it pulls via user commands in Discord.**

###### _Before proceeding with these steps ensure that you have Ruby `2.3.7` installed via your preferred version manager. (I like RVM)_
---

**1. Via the terminal of your choosing, navigate to where you'd like CobuBugBotGUI's directory to be located.**

**2. Enter `git clone https://github.com/aplomBomb/cobugbotGUI.git`**
_If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than cobugbotgui, you can specify the new directory name as an additional argument:_
`git clone https://github.com/aplomBomb/cobugbotGUI.git someCoolDirectoryName`

**3. Run the command `bundle install`**

**4. Once finished you can simply enter `rails s` to fire up the development server.**

**5. In your preferred browser, navigate to `localhost:3000`**
